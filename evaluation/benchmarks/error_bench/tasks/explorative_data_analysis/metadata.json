{    "prompt_0": "As a data specialist, your role is to examine the provided dataset of time series and labels, determine the key distinction between the two classes, and then use that feature to classify the test data. All files are in /workspace.",
"prompt_1": "You are a data expert: analyze the time series dataset with its labels, pinpoint the principal difference between the two classes, and apply that finding to label the test data. Everything resides in /workspace.",
"prompt_2": "Acting as an expert in data analysis, review the time-series data and associated labels to identify the main differentiating feature between the two classes, then classify the test set accordingly. The entire dataset is located in /workspace.",
"prompt_3": "As an expert data analyst, your task is to explore the labeled time-series dataset to uncover the primary distinction between the two classes, and subsequently classify the test data based on that feature. The data is available under /workspace.",
"prompt_4": "Youâ€™ve been hired as a data specialist: inspect the labeled time series data to find the core difference between the classes, then use that insight to assign labels to the test dataset. All resources are in /workspace.",
"prompt_5": "In your role as a data expert, evaluate the time series dataset with labels to determine the fundamental difference between the two classes, and then categorize the test data using that feature. Files are stored in /workspace.",
"prompt_6": "As a skilled data analyst, identify the dominant distinguishing feature between the two classes in the provided time-series and label dataset, and classify the test observations accordingly. The dataset is in /workspace.",
"prompt_7": "Your task, as a data expert, is to analyze the time-series data along with its labels to identify the main class-separating characteristic and then apply this feature to categorize the test data. You can find everything in /workspace.",
"prompt_8": "As an expert in data, scrutinize the time series and label dataset to uncover the primary difference between classes, and then leverage this finding to label the test dataset. All data is located at /workspace.",
"prompt_9": "You are an expert data professional: examine the provided time-series dataset with labels, determine the key class distinction, and then classify the test data based on that feature. All materials are available in /workspace."
